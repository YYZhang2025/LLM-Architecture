Once upon a time, in a small world, there lived a loud bird named Lulu. Lulu loved to lean on a big tree and sing her songs. All the animals in the world could hear her. One sunny day, Lulu met a shy cat named Cici. Lulu said, "Hi, I am Lulu. I like to lean on the tree and sing loud songs. Do you want to sing with me?" Cici looked at Lulu and said, "I am Cici. I like to be quiet, but I will try to sing with you." So, Lulu and Cici leaned on the big tree and sang songs together. Lulu sang loud, and Cici sang soft. All the animals in the world listened and liked their songs. From that day on, Lulu and Cici became good friends and sang together every day. One day, a little boy named Tim went on a march with his toy soldiers. He loved to play with his soldiers in the yard. As they marched, Tim found a hole in the ground. "This hole is mine!" he said. Tim called his friend, Sue, to come see the hole. When Sue came, she said, "This hole is terrible! It's too big." Tim and Sue looked at the hole and wondered what could be inside. Just then, a big, friendly dog jumped out of the hole! Tim and Sue were so surprised. The dog wagged its tail and wanted to play. They all played together and had a fun day.

Leo was scared, but he wanted to try. So, he took a deep breath and let out a tiny roar. The flower did not move, but his friends cheered for him
