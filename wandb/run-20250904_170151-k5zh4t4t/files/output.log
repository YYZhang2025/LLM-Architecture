They get coal on their hands and clothes. They hear their mom calling them. "Tim, Lily, come inside! It's time for hot chocolate!" They leave the snowman and run to the house. They wash their hands and drink their hot chocolate. They tell their mom about the snowman and the coal. Their mom smiles and says, "Maybe next time you can use some buttons or raisins for the mouth. They are smaller and lighter than coal." Tim and Lily nod. They think that is a good idea. They want to make another snowman tomorrow. They hope the snow does not melt.

You found a special ball!" Tim and the dog played with the golden ball all day and became best friends. Once upon a time, there was a rich girl named Lily. She lived in a big house with her family. One day, Lily went outside to play. But then, the rain started to fall. Lily didn't like getting wet, so she ran back inside the house. Inside, Lily wanted to play a game. She chose to play hide and seek with her toy bear, Mr. Cuddles. She closed her eyes and counted to ten. When she opened her eyes, she looked for Mr. Cuddles. He was hiding under a chair. Lily laughed and picked him up. Lily and Mr. Cuddles played hide and seek all day long. They hid in many places, like under the bed and behind the door. The rain stopped, but they kept playing inside. Lily was very happy to have a fun day with her toy bear. One day, a shy boy named Tim went to the park with his dad. They wanted to play baseball. Tim was a little scared because he had never played before. His dad said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will teach you how to play. It will be fun!" Tim and his dad started to play. They threw the baseball to each other. Tim was getting better and better. Then, something unexpected happened. A big bird flew down and took the baseball in its beak! The bird flew up high and then it started to dive down fast. As the bird dived, Tim got ready. He jumped up and caught the baseball just before it hit the ground. Tim's dad was so happy and proud. He said, "Wow, Tim! You did it! You saved the baseball and played so well!" Tim smiled and felt brave. From that day on, Tim loved to play baseball with his dad at the park. Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to jog and play with his toys. One day, Tim went to the park with his toy car. At the park, he met a girl named Lily. Lily had a toy too, but it was a disgusting, slimy toy frog. "Eww, that's yucky!" said Tim. "Why do you like that toy?" Lily laughed and said, "It's not yucky! It's fun and squishy. Do you want to try?" Tim was scared, but he wanted to be nice. So he touched the slimy toy frog. It felt weird, but it was fun too. Tim and Lily played with their toys and jogged around the park together. They became good friends, and they learned that even if something looks yucky, it can still be fun. And they lived happily ever after. One day, a big dog named Max went to the park. He liked to play with his ball and run fast. Max saw a little cat named Kitty. Kitty was scared of Max because he was big. Max wanted to be friends with Kitty, so he tried to act nice. Max and Kitty started to play together in the park. They played with the ball and ran around. But then, they heard a loud alarm. They both got very scared. They did not know what to do. Max and Kitty looked around to find where the sound was coming from. Then, they saw a little bird that was stuck in a tree. The bird was making the alarm sound because it needed help. Max and Kitty worked together to help the little bird. Max used his big body to shake the tree, and Kitty jumped high to catch the bird. They saved the bird, and it was happy. Max and Kitty were happy too, because they became friends and did something good together. One day, a little ant was looking for food. He saw a big cake on a high table. He wanted to eat some of the cake, but he did not know how to reach it. He asked his friend, a spider, for help. "Spider, can you help me get some cake?" he said. "Sure, ant. I can spin a web and pull you up to the table. But you have to share the cake with me," said the spider. "OK, spider. Thank you for helping me," said the ant. The spider spun a web and lifted the ant to the table. The ant and the spider started to eat the cake. They were very happy. But then, it started to rain. The rain was very heavy and loud. The ant and the spider were scared. The rain made the web wet and weak. The web broke and the ant and the spider fel
